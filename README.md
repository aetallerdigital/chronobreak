# Chronobreak
Open-source Pomodoro timer made in **Electron** that extra faithfully replicates the original technique, made in procrastination by Jordan Peters (Rollersteaam).

The first release of Chronobreak has been committed. Offers the basic functionality of an ordinary pomodoro timer but with enhanced interactions.

**Drag** clock numbers to set in place the set timings, and hear each **click** along the way. Initiate every session with a **physical act**, adding focus and flow via visual, audible and physical cues. And finally, set **target focuses** for a work block to determine your specific tasks. Timer completion cues and subtle drones, as well as an optional ticking of a timer each play their part in a very enjoyable timer.

# Installation
Go to the **Releases** tab and download the latest version's **.zip archive**. Unzip it and run the **'Chronobreak' shortcut**.

## Want to contribute?
I would absolutely love for you to iterate on my design and improve it. Since this is my first rodeo with Electron and first real application of Javascript, much of my code could easily do with an improvement - such as modularization or classes.

Feel free to create a **fork** and a make a **pull request** when you've made good changes you want me to add to the project.

With good help, we could make a simple but brilliant technique even stronger as a productivity tool.
