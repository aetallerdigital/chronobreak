# Chronobreak
Open-source Pomodoro timer made in **Electron** that faithfully replicates the original technique, made in procrastination by Jordan Peters (Rollersteaam).

**Drag clock numbers to set in place the set timings,** and hear each click along the way. **By initiating every session with a physical act,** focus and flow is created through the visual and audio cues as your session has an increased sense of purpose. You may also choose to **set target focuses for a block of work** to determine your specific tasks. Timer completion cues and drones, as well as an optional ticking of a timer each play their part in making a pretty 'alive' timer.

# Latest: Version 1.1.0
This version is a major quality-of-life adjustment to Chronobreak as I've used it personally over the last 6 months, as well as reading some feedback online about the app itself.

## General
- A new logo has now been added (Credits to [redmusic](https://utopian.io/@redmusic))
- The timer will now automatically pop up (or at least try to) on completion of a phase.
- The timer will now change UI when it's active.
- A chime will now play when a timer has been activated.
- The appearance of the right-click tray menu has been changed so it's more difficult to accidently discard a pomodoro.
- Work phase completion song has been changed because of how annoying it was before.
- Tick tock sound is now turned off by default. No need to turn it off each time you launch Chronobreak.
- Updated showcase gif to show new changes.

## Issues
- Pomodoro completion music has been turned down a good amount (8db) and remastered to account for the weird bass distortion.
- Corrected text about how much work was accomplished in a session.
- Changed some text on 'Small Break' phase to offer more helpful suggestions.

# Installation
Go to the **Releases** tab and download the latest version's **.zip archive**. Unzip it and run the **'Chronobreak' shortcut**.
